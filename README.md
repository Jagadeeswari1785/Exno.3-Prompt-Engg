### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

Prompt and Output
1. Direct Instruction Prompt

Use Case: Definition Request

Scenario: Student asks, “What is Ohm’s Law?”

Response: “Ohm’s Law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided the temperature remains constant.”

2. Contextual Prompting

Use Case: Simplifying Explanation

Scenario: Student says, “I still don’t get Ohm’s Law.”

Response: “No worries! Think of it like water in a pipe: Voltage is like water pressure, current is the flow, and resistance is how narrow the pipe is. More pressure means more flow, unless the pipe is too narrow.”

3. Persona-Based Prompting

Use Case: Friendly & Motivating

Scenario: Student says, “I feel physics is too hard.”

Response: “Hey, I get it! Physics can feel tricky at first, but you’re already doing great by asking questions. Let’s break it down step by step—I’ll be with you until you get it!”

4. Few-Shot Prompting

Use Case: Math Problem Solving

Scenario: Student says, “Solve 2x + 5 = 15.”

Response:
“Example: x + 3 = 7 → x = 4.
Now for your problem:
2x + 5 = 15 → 2x = 10 → x = 5.”

5. Chain of Thought Prompting

Use Case: Physics Problem

Scenario: Student asks, “A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s² for 5 seconds. Find the final velocity.”

Response:
“Step 1: Formula: v = u + at.
Step 2: u = 0, a = 2, t = 5.
Step 3: v = 0 + (2 × 5) = 10 m/s.
Final Answer: The car’s final velocity is 10 m/s.”

6. Instruction with Constraints

Use Case: Quick Revision

Scenario: Student says, “Summarize photosynthesis.”

Response (≤40 words):
“Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (food) and oxygen.”

7. Reflective Prompting

Use Case: Query Confirmation

Scenario: Student says, “How do I calculate resistance?”

Response:
“You’re asking how to calculate resistance, correct? The formula is R = V / I, where R is resistance, V is voltage, and I is current.”

Conclusion

Different prompting strategies were applied to design a virtual learning assistant capable of handling student queries in definitions, problem-solving, motivation, and quick revisions. Each pattern ensured better adaptability and user-friendly interactions.

Result

Thus, the various types of prompts were executed successfully.
